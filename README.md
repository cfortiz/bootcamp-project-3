## Track

For this project, we have selected the Data Visualization track.

## Objective

The World Happiness Report aims to assess and rank countries based on 
the  well-being and happiness of their citizens. It seeks to influence 
policymakers by highlighting the importance of happiness and well-being 
in societal development, encouraging efforts to improve the quality of 
life for all individuals.

The primary objective of this data visualization project is to provide
insightful, interactive visual representations of happiness level across
various demographics using a detailed dataset. The aim is to highlight 
patterns and correlations between happiness level and various indicators 
such as income, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life 
choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

## Goals

* To create visualizations revealing patterns in happiness level across
  different demographics.
* To utilize interactive elements to enhance user experience and
  facilitate exploration of the data.
* To use a Python or JavaScript visualization library not previously
  covered in class for innovative data representation.
* To extract and analyze data stored in a database.

## Dataset Overview
