## Track

For this project, we have selected the Data Visualization track.

## Objective

The growing impact of mental health necessitates a deeper understanding of how
various factors like work type, age, gender, and support structures influence
mental well-being. Using an interactive visualization approach, this project
aims to uncover and present trends within a mental health dataset, providing
better understanding and insight.

The primary objective of this data visualization project is to provide
insightful, interactive visual representations of mental health trends across
various demographics using a detailed dataset. The aim is to highlight patterns
and correlations between mental health issues and various factors such as
occupation, self-employment status, family history, and lifestyle changes.

## Goals

* To create visualizations revealing patterns in mental health across different
  demographics and environments.
* To utilize interactive elements to enhance user experience and facilitate
  exploration of the data.
* To use a Python or JavaScript visualization library not previously covered in
  class for innovative data representation.
* To extract and analyze data stored in a database.

## Dataset Overview

* **Dataset Source**: [Kaggle - Mental Health Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/mental-health-dataset/data)
* **Content**: The dataset contains more than 100 records, with variables like
  age, gender, work type, and mental health indicators, providing a
  comprehensive view of mental health issues within the workplace.
* **Storage**: The dataset will be imported into a database for efficient
  querying and extraction during analysis.
