## Track

For this project, we have selected the Data Visualization track.

## Objective

The World Happiness Report aims to assess and rank countries based on
the  well-being and happiness of their citizens. It seeks to influence
policymakers by highlighting the importance of happiness and well-being
in societal development, encouraging efforts to improve the quality of
life for all individuals.

The primary objective of this data visualization project is to provide
insightful, interactive visual representations of happiness level across
various demographics using a detailed dataset. The aim is to highlight
patterns and correlations between happiness level and various indicators
such as income, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life
choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

## Goals

* To create visualizations revealing patterns in happiness level across
  different demographics.
* To utilize interactive elements to enhance user experience and
  facilitate exploration of the data.
* To use a Python or JavaScript visualization library not previously
  covered in class for innovative data representation.
* To extract and analyze data stored in a database.

## Dataset Overview

* **Dataset Source**: [World Happiness Report Appendices & Data](https://worldhappiness.report/data/)
* **Content**: The dataset contains mre than 2500 records, with the following
  variables providing a comprehensive view of happiness level:
  * **Life Ladder:** A subjective measure where individuals rate
    their current lives on a scale from 0 to 10, reflecting personal
    life satisfaction and well-being
  * **GDP per capita:** Measures the average income per capita,
    reflecting the economic resources available to individuals.
  * **Social support:** Assesses the presence of supportive relationships
    and community ties that individuals can rely on in times of need. 
  * **Healthy life expectancy at birth:** Indicates the average number
    of years people can expect to live in good health, reflecting overall
    health and healthcare quality.
  * **Freedom to make life choices:** Evaluates the extent to which individuals
    feel they have the autonomy to make choices about their own lives.
  * **Generosity:** Looks at the level of charitable donations and volunteerism,
    reflecting a societyâ€™s willingness to help others.
  * **Perceptions of corruption:** Measures how corrupt people perceive their
    government and business sectors, influencing trust and societal well-being.
  * **Positive affect:** Measure of laugh, enjoyment and doing interesting things.
  * **Negative affect:** Measure of worry, sadness and anger.

* **Storage**: The dataset will be imported into a database for efficient
  querying and extraction during analysis.

## Visualizations

### JavaScript Mapping

This is a Leaflet visualization that allows the user to visualize each variable
in the dataset by year randing from 2005 to 2023 through an interactive map.

### Time Series Map

This is a Leaflet visualization that allows the user to visualize the happiness
(a.k.a. ladder) variable from 2008 - 2023 through an animated world map.

### Statistical Analysis

This is a Jupyter Notebook that visualizes a few things:

* Freedom to Make Life Choices vs Perception of Corruption as a scatter plot
* Happiness (Life Ladder) vs Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth as a bubble chart,
  with the size of each bubble scaled by Freedom to Make Life Choices.
* Variable correlation Heat Map: a graded (1.0 green - -1.0 red) heat map of the
  correlation of each variable against other variables.
* Life Ladder vs Log GDP Per Capita as a scatter plot with regression line.
* Top and Bottom countries by Average Life Ladder (happiness metric) for the
  2024 report (2023 data) as bar charts for the top 10 and bottom 10 countries.

### Streamlit Interactive Dashboard

Streamlit python framework dashboard with two tabs.

The "2024 World Map" tab portrays a visualization of the 2024 variable values by
country (interactive) as well as a color-graded heat-map of the happiness metric
for the entire world by country for year 2024.

The "Compare Countries by Year" tab is an interactive visualization of the time
series data for any variable and chosen year range for the country selected in
the "2024 World Map" tab.  This allows the user to select a country in the
"2024 World Map" tab, and then drill down to compare the time series values of
any of the variables, instead of a static view for year 2024.
