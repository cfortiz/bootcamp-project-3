## Track

For this project, we have selected the Data Visualization track.

## Objective

The growing impact of mental health necessitates a deeper understanding of how
various factors influence happiness level. Using an interactive visualization 
approach, this project aims to uncover and present trends within a happiness 
level dataset, providing better understanding and insight.

The primary objective of this data visualization project is to provide
insightful, interactive visual representations of happiness level across
various demographics using a detailed dataset. The aim is to highlight patterns
and correlations between happiness level and various factors such as
economic development, social support, and lift expectancy.

## Goals

* To create visualizations revealing patterns in happiness level across different
  demographics and environments.
* To utilize interactive elements to enhance user experience and facilitate
  exploration of the data.
* To use a Python or JavaScript visualization library not previously covered in
  class for innovative data representation.
* To extract and analyze data stored in a database.

## Dataset Overview
